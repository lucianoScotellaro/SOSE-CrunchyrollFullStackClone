# Crunchyroll Full-Stack Clone

## Introduction

Crunchyroll Full-Stack Clone is an application developed as end-of-course project for the course of **Service-Oriented Software Engineering**.

The project was developed based on the reported [assignment](./assignment.pdf). Since the domain and the purpose of the application were arbitrary, the idea was to experiment with an **over-the-top video on-demand system**. The goal was therefore to build a well-engineered system capable of storing and delivering video content.

The choice was mainly driven by the required **microservices** architectural style, that perfectly meets the most relevant [**non-functional requirements**](./docs/requirements.md/#non-functional) of such a system. Notably: **performance**, **scalability** and **availability**.

Below are reported:

- Project's [setup](#setup), to locally run the application
- Project's [main features](#systems-main-features)

A deeper look into system's [requirements](./docs/requirements.md), [structure and behavior](./docs/diagrams/) is provided through the [docs](./docs/) folder.
