# Crunchyroll Full-Stack Clone

## Introduction

Crunchyroll Full-Stack Clone is an application developed as end-of-course project for the course of **Service-Oriented Software Engineering**.

The project is based on the reported [specification](./assignment.pdf). Since the domain and the purpose of the application were arbitrary, the idea was to experiment with an **over-the-top video on-demand system**, leveraging a content-delivery network for better performance.

Below are reported:

- Project's [setup](#setup) to locally run the application
- Project's [main features](#systems-main-features)

In addition, a deeper look into system's [requirements](./docs/requirements.md), [structure and behavior](./docs/diagrams/) is provided though the [docs](./docs/) folder.
